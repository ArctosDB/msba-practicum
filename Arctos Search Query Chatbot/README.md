# Arctos Search Query Chatbot


This AI-powered Streamlit chatbot enables users to query the Arctos biodiversity database using natural language (e.g., “Find fish collected in Alaska in 2001”). It extracts structured fields from the input, generates a corresponding Arctos search URL, and optionally displays sample results from the Arctos API.

Built as part of a UC Davis MSBA practicum project in collaboration with the **Museum of Vertebrate Zoology (MVZ)** and the **Arctos Consortium**, the tool significantly simplifies search workflows for curators, researchers, and external users.
